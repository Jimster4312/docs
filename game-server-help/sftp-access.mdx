<Info>
  You will need a FTP/SFTP app on your PC such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
</Info>

In this tutorial we will use [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)

Firstly start by getting your SFTP details by going to your servers "**Settings**" tab and look for the section named "**SFTP Details**".

In the SFTP app put in the following settings:

**Host** - The "Server Address" from the SFTP Details **without the port** (the bit that looks like `:2022` ). It should look something like this: `sftp://node.talldwarfhosting.com`

**Username** - The "Username" from SFTP Details. It should look like: `user.89h843` 

**Password** - This is the password you use to login to you **Game Panel** account.

**Port** - From the "Server Address" after `:` . _Note: If you do not know try "2022" as all our nodes are configured to use port 2022._

### Final Result

Your final result should look something close to this:

| **Host**                         | **Username** | **Password** | **Port** |
| :------------------------------: | :----------: | :----------: | :------: |
| sftp://node.talldwarfhosting.com | user.89h843  | ●●●●●●       | 2022     |

Thats all\!
