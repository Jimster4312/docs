## Changing your MOTD

### Basic Method

**Access your Server Files:**

- Login to your [Game Panel](https://panel.talldwarfhosting.com/auth/login)
- Navigate to your server's **Files** section
- Open the `server.properties` file

**Locate the MOTD Setting:**

- Find the line that starts with `motd=`
- By default, it will be something like `motd=A Minecraft Server`

**Edit the MOTD**

- Replace the text after `motd=` with your custom message
- For example: `motd=Welcome to My Awesome Server!`

**Save and Restart**

- Click the **Save Content** button
- Restart your server for the changes to take effect

### Advaced Formatting

You can add colours and formatting to your MOTD using Minecraft's (MOTD) formatting codes:

| **Code** | **Effect**        |
| :------: | :---------------: |
| \\u00A70 | Black             |
| \\u00A71 | Dark Blue         |
| \\u00A72 | Dark Green        |
| \\u00A73 | Dark Aqua         |
| \\u00A74 | Dark Red          |
| \\u00A7a | Green             |
| \\u00A7b | Aqua              |
| \\u00A7c | Red               |
| \\u00A7l | **Bold**          |
| \\u00A7n | <u>Underlines</u> |

**Example:** `\u00A71TallDwarf Hosting \u00A77 Example MOTD`
