## **Online Mode Settings**[**​**](https://help.talldwarfhosting.com/docs/minecraft-server-safety#online-mode-settings)

One of the most critical security settings for your Minecraft server is the "Online Mode" option.

### **What is Online Mode?**[**​**](https://help.talldwarfhosting.com/docs/minecraft-server-safety#what-is-online-mode)

When enabled, Online Mode verifies each player's identity with Mojang's authentication servers before allowing them to connect. This ensures that:

1. Players are using legitimate, purchased Minecraft accounts
2. Players cannot impersonate others by using their usernames
3. Various security exploits are prevented

### **Configuration Options**[**​**](https://help.talldwarfhosting.com/docs/minecraft-server-safety#configuration-options)

#### **Online Mode: TRUE (Recommended)**[**​**](https://help.talldwarfhosting.com/docs/minecraft-server-safety#online-mode-true-recommended)

```
online-mode=true
```

**Benefits**:

- Only legitimate Minecraft accounts can connect
- Players cannot impersonate others
- Better protection against certain security exploits
- Compatible with most premium plugins

**When to use**: For most servers, especially public ones or those with valuable builds and economies.

#### **Online Mode: FALSE**[**​**](https://help.talldwarfhosting.com/docs/minecraft-server-safety#online-mode-false)

```
online-mode=false
```

**Note**: This setting is **not recommended** unless you have a specific need, such as:

- Creating a "cracked" server (allowing non-premium Minecraft accounts)
- Setting up a server behind a proxy like BungeeCord (requires additional security measures)

**Risks**:

- Anyone can join using any username
- No verification of player identity
- Vulnerable to certain security exploits
- Potential for griefing and unauthorized access

### **How to Change Online Mode**[**​**](https://help.talldwarfhosting.com/docs/minecraft-server-safety#how-to-change-online-mode)

1. Log in to your [Game Panel](https://panel.talldwarfhosting.com/auth/login)
2. Navigate to your server's **Files** section
3. Locate and open the `server.properties` file
4. Find the line with `online-mode=true` (or `false`)
5. Set it to your desired value
6. Save the file and restart your server

## **Additional Security Measures**[**​**](https://help.talldwarfhosting.com/docs/minecraft-server-safety#additional-security-measures)

For comprehensive server security, consider implementing these additional measures:

1. **Install an Anti-Grief Plugin** like CoreProtect
2. **Set Up Permissions** with a plugin like LuckPerms
3. **Use Whitelist Mode** for private servers
4. **Install Authentication Plugins** if running in offline mode
5. **Keep Your Server Updated** to the latest Minecraft version
6. **Regularly Backup Your World** to prevent data loss

Remember that security is an ongoing process. Regularly review your server's logs and security settings to ensure it remains protected.
