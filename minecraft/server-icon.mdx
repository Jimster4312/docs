title: "Changing your Minecraft servers icon"
---

<Note>
  Your server icon **must** be a 64x64 png

  This can be done on a tool such as [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/)
</Note>

The filename for your server icon **must** be `server-icon.png`

## Step-by-Step Instructions

**Prepare Your Icon:**

- Create or find a suitable 64x64 pixel image
- If you need to create one, we recommend using [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) or another image editor
- Save the image as `server-icon.png`

**Upload to your Server:**

- Login to your [Game Panel](https://panel.talldwarfhosting.com)
- Navigate to your server and open the **Files** section
- If a `server-icon.png` file aleady exists, delete it
- Click **Upload** and select your new icon files
- Make sure the filename is exactly `server-icon.png` (case sensitive)

**Make the icon show up:**

- Restart your Minecraft Server
- The new icon will appear in the multiplayer menu after the restart.

## Troubleshooting

If your icon doesn't appear, follow these steps:

- Confirm the image is exactly 64x64 pixels
- Make sure the filename is `server-icon.png` with no capital letters or underscores
- Verify that the file is in the main server directory (normally `/home/container`)
- Check that the file is using the **PNG** format
- Try a different image if the problem persists. We offer our own image [here](https://cdn.talldwarfhosting.com/panel/images/server_icon.png).
