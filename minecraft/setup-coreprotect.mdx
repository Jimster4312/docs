# **What is CoreProtect?**

[CoreProtect](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/) is a useful plugin that allows you to log everything that happens on your Minecraft Server

This can be very useful on public multiplayer servers, where there is a high chance of griefers, robbers and other malicous players, allowing you to roll back previous versions of almost everything that has happened, from yesterday to a week ago.

# **Installation**

If you want to install CoreProtect through downloading a file:

1. Navigate to the [CoreProtect Spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/) and download the latest version
2. Open your server in our [Game Panel](https://panel.talldwarfhosting.com/)
3. Navigate to the `File Manager` tab
4. Open your `plugins` folder
5. Upload the CoreProtect .jar file
6. **Restart** your server to complete the installation

When your server restarts, you should see CoreProtect initializing in the console.

# **Begin using CoreProtect**

CoreProtect provides powerful tools to track and reverse changes on your server.

<Info>
  CoreProtect will only start logging actions from **when it is installed**. It cannot track changes made before installation.

## **Inspection Mode**[**​**](https://help.talldwarfhosting.com/docs/minecraft-server-coreprotect#inspection-mode)

Inspection mode allows you to click on blocks to see their history:

```
/co i        # Toggle inspection mode on/off
```

When enabled, left-clicking any block will show you who placed or changed it.

## **Common Use Cases**[**​**](https://help.talldwarfhosting.com/docs/minecraft-server-coreprotect#common-use-cases)

- **Finding Griefers**: Use `/co lookup r:10 t:2d` to check recent changes in an area
- **Recovering Stolen Items**: Use `/co lookup a:chest u:suspectedPlayer`
- **Undoing Damage**: Use `/co rollback u:griefer t:1d` to undo a day's worth of grief
