<Note>
  _Affiliate marketing is a marketing arrangement in which affiliates receive a commission for each visit, signup or sale they generate for a merchant. This arrangement allows businesses to outsource part of the sales process._

  \
  To put it simply, you get a custom link from us (e.g. `https://billing.talldwarfhosting.com?a=YOUR_CODE` OR `https://talldwarf.host/a/YOUR_CODE`), and whenever someone signs up and purchases services using your link, you earn a commission from us.
